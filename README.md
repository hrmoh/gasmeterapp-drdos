## Persian Gas Metering App for Symbol PDT 3100 (DR-DOS)

This is the source code for a gas meter reading app (barcode based) I had developed around 2009 or so to use Symbol PDT 3100 handheld devices (DR-DOS based) for collecting gas meter data.

I do not now recall even how I did compile this code (there must be some SDK and tools provided by vendors).

It requires an Iran System compatible font to be installed on the device (FARSI.FNT on root of drive B). I may be able to find compiled binaries and installation instructions somewhere and publish them through releases.

Application end user manual in Persian is still available [here](http://arakara.gozir.com/products/3100/manual/).
